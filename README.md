# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## üë©‚Äçüíª About Me
I am an experienced and passionate .NET Software Developer and Architect. These areas are my jam, with plenty of hands-on experience:

- **Desktop Applications for Windows**
- **Database Solutions (Relational and NoSQL databases)**
- **Web Applications (Frontend and Backend, ASP.NET Core, Angular, and Blazor)**
- **Network and Communication Software (Development and integration of proprietary protocols, protocol analyzers, and client-server applications)**
- **Microservices and Event-Driven Systems**
- **Cloud-Based Solutions on Azure (Docker, Azure Container Apps, Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Static Web Apps, Azure DevOps CI/CD)**

I love tackling complex problems and building applications that provide value to users and organizations alike.
When I'm not coding, I enjoy listening to history podcasts (especially about ancient history), doing a bit of exercise (not too much), or taking walks in nature.
